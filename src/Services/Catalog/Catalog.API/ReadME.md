# This Microservice is using the Vertical Slice Architecture

In **Vertical Slice Architecture** for ASP.NET Core, the application is divided into "slices" based on features or use cases, rather than layers (like traditional N-tier architecture). Each slice contains everything needed to handle a specific feature or request, including:

- **Data models**
- **Business logic**
- **Commands/Queries**
- **Controllers** (or API endpoints)

### Key Points:
- Each vertical slice is **self-contained**.
- It promotes **modularity** and **separation of concerns** by isolating each feature.
- It can easily integrate with **CQRS** (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) for handling queries and commands separately.
  
### Benefits:
- Better for **scalability** and **maintainability**.
- **Easier to test** and understand individual features.
- Allows teams to work on different features independently. 

In ASP.NET Core, you'd often structure this using **folders by feature** instead of by layers (e.g., Controllers, Services, Repositories).
